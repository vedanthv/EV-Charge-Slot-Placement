# EV-Charge-Slot-Prediction
This project is aimed towards predicting the correct placements of EV Charging Points at various points around the globe.

# Introduction

Introduction
The mobility sector accounts for around 18% of the carbon dioxide emissions from
burning fuel. A considerable market share of electric vehicles (EVs) running on clean
power is key to mobility decarbonisation. As the number of EVs on our roads continues
to increase, the demand for charging is following suit. Today around 10% of drivers are
choosing EVs when buying a new car, and this is expected to grow rapidly
. We need
accelerated technology and infrastructure development to support EV market growth.
While EV drivers are looking for a charging experience that is as fast and comfortable
as possible, the main obstacle to mobility decarbonisation is inconvenience caused by
charging infrastructure and charging time. Proper placement of charging points can
alleviate this problem. It is a subject of current research and business interest
simultaneously and has immense implications for the adoption of EVs, including:
1. lowering range anxiety among EV owners,
2. optimal utilisation of EV charging points,
3. minimal travel time and waiting time for EV owners.
